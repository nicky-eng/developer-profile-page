                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>After graduating in Mechanical Engineering I worked in the OCTG industry 
                    and later I was a full-time head teaching assistant at the Mechanical Engineering
                    department at my alma mater for a period of over 6 years. During this time I started programming
                    in MATLAB and Arduino for work and also as a hobby.</p>
                <p>While learning Python and web technologies for IOT devices
                    I discovered a passion for programming, so when COVID forced us into quarantine in March 2020, and all things remote, 
                    I began an Algorithms and Data Structures course and 3 months later I got my first developer job
                    as a Django Developer Trainee.</p>
                <p>In December 2020 I quit my teaching job and became a full time developer. I am now concentrating primarily in
                    backend development using Python and Django. </p>
